## ðŸ“œ Introduction
The `push_swap` project is an exercise in data sorting. Using a stack of integers, the goal is to sort the numbers using a limited set of operations. This project tackles this problem using the binary radix sort algorithm, ensuring efficient and fast sorting.

## ðŸ“Œ Implementation Details of `push_swap`

In this project, the `push_swap` program sorts a stack of integers using the **binary radix sort** algorithm. Here's a quick overview of how it works:

- The program takes a stack, named 'a', as its input. This stack is a list of integers.
- Leveraging the efficiency of binary radix sort, the program determines the minimal set of operations needed to ensure that stack 'a' is sorted in ascending order.
- Any discrepancies, such as non-integer arguments, are swiftly handled, ensuring the program runs smoothly and effectively.

With this approach, sorting even large stacks becomes more efficient and faster, showcasing the power of the binary radix sort algorithm.

## ðŸš€ Compilation & Usage

Ensure you're on a system with a C compiler.

### Compilation
Compile the project with the provided Makefile.
```bash
make
```

### Execution
Execute the program by passing the stack 'a' as an argument.
```bash
./push_swap 4 67 3 87 23
```
